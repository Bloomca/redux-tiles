# Before you step in

This library is not intended to be used by complete novices in Redux – in fact, it might hurt you in a long run; so you should be comfortable creating simple redux entities by hand – storing some synchronous data, and you should now what approaches exist to handle async flow in Redux. The reason behind it is that without this prior art, you risk to believe that this library does some magic, while it does not at all! And you should be able to pick up any part of it, in case you need to use some constant, or pick up selector by hand from created tile.

## Content

This chapter explains why this library was created and with which concepts behind it, as well as some comparison and little examples. Don't keep it as a proper resource to learn about Redux or other solutions – don't hesitate to read about them in detail on their official documentation!
Also, if all of this is clear for you, don't be afraid to go directly to the [API](../api/README.md) or [examples](../examples/README.md).
