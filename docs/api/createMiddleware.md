# Middleware Overview

[Middleware](http://redux.js.org/docs/advanced/Middleware.html) in Redux processes actions, so you might return not just plain objects with `type` and `payload` properties, but also promises, functions and so on – just handle it with appropriate middleware. There are several really popular libraries, but the most basic and popular, I think, is [redux-thunk](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk), the most basic middleware to deal with async requests. While this is a great middleware, it is dead simple, and I'd recommend to use middleware from this library (also, I highly recommend to take a look at the source code of them – they are _really_ simple – [redux-tiles middleware](https://github.com/Bloomca/redux-tiles/blob/master/src/middleware.ts) and [redux-thunk middleware](https://github.com/gaearon/redux-thunk/blob/master/src/index.js)).
