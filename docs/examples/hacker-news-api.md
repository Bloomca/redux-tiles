# HackerNews API with redux-tiles

Let's build a real API tiles for hacker news. We will create a simple functionality, which will allow us to download pages by category (e.g. top stories, or new stories), with items automatically downloaded and populated as well.
We will use official [HN API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API), which is hosted on firebase. API setup is out of scope of this tutorial, so if you have more questions, please use following links:

- [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)
