# TodoMVC application

This is an example how one can use redux-tiles for fully synchronous applications, like [todoMVC](http://todomvc.com/). There is no async functionality here, which makes it not a particularly good example, but it gives a general overview how things can be constructed. We store here a list and make operations on it, and also keep filtering.
You can take a look at these tiles in [todos-tiles](./src/tiles/todos.js).

This is a complete application, so you can run it by yourself:
```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```
