# Example of usage

These are examples of typical usage of redux-tiles. Please, be aware that none of those are truly "beginner-level", because the library itself provides only an abstraction on top of Redux, but still reqiures from you knowledge how to do everything of it by hand, so there is no magic from you (otherwise this "magic" part will hit you sooner or later). But don't be intimidated â€“ it is enough to understand how to handle async code in Redux and to be able to write merging reducer by hand.
